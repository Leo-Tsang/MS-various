This was the final project for my DS8001 course. Design of Algorithms and Programming for Massive Data

We were tasked with building an initial dataset of 1million row x 20 Attributes


With our dataset we were to build a Metric Inverted File (MIF) with 1000 Reference Points


Our final task was to use a approximate search algorithm to search our MIF file
